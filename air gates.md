# air gates

These are effetely airlocks. Instead of two doors they are a single film that can be walked through. As a person with an [[oxygen shield]] walks through, the film joins to the shield and it means no air escapes. If someone *without* and [[oxygen shield]] passes through then the film must wrap around them front and back as they pass through, using far more energy.
