# Atkins Augmentation

Owned by [[Pike Atkins]], this is a small shop in the [[City Side]] where people go to get cybernetic enhancements.

If [[Astroid 4k2l]] is the first astroid they visit in [[The Scrapyard belt]] they will go here to get their [[oxygen shield]] implanted. People often get digits or even lost limbs replaced here.
