# Community Halls

These are community spaces that link to [[The Residential Tunnels]], some also link to the surface of [[Astroid 4k2l]].

Each hall is a large cuboid space with bright lighting and many plants and greenery scattered around. Sometimes one side of the room is taken up by a bar or restaurant.

The biggest hall is the one closest to the main entrance to the underground section of [[City Side]] and has a bar that is usually tended by [[Alexander Losser]]. It is also home to the [[Healers office]]
