# Signal Side

This side of the astroid is so named because of the old signal tower implanted into the ground here. It's considered effectively equivalent to the north pole of the astroid.

The signal tower is half functional and is used by the inhabitants of the asteroid to commune with people outside [[The Scrapyard belt]]
