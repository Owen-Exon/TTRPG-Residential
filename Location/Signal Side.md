# Signal Side

This side of the astroid is so named because of the old signal tower implanted into the ground here. It's considered effectively equivalent to the north pole of the astroid.

The signal tower is half functional and is used mostly by [[The Bookkeepers Building|The Bookkeepers]] to commune with people outside [[The Scrapyard belt]]

It is also used by [[The watchers]] to monitor the asteroid for amalgamations or other dangers.
