# Sector 4 - Calm Region

Protected by the gravitation anomalies from [[Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core|Sector 2]] this is the region most [[astro scrap hunters]] end up basing themselves. It doesn't have the best scrap, so most travel to the [[Sector 5 - Dense Region|Dense Region]] to hunt for valuables.

This region contains [[Astroid 4k2l]]
