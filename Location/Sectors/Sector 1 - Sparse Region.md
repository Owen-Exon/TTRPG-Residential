# Sector 1 - Sparse Region

This area has been almost been fully cleared out by [[astro scrap hunters]] and [[Amalgamations]], all that is left is any asteroids made of truly useless scrap.

The clockwise area tends to be avoided even when people do venture here due to it's proximity to the [[Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core| Amalgamation Core]] and its abundance of [[Amalgamations]]
