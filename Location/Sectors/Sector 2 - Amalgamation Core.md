# Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core

This sector is full of [[Amalgamations]].

At its centre there is a a massive astroid (several times bigger than any other in the belt) made from hundreds of thousands of faulty robots amalgamated together. Despite the chaos of normal [[Amalgamations]] at such a large scale there seems to be some kind of emergent effect where from the chaos an intelligence greater than any of its parts has formed.

The only goal of this intelligence is to expand itself and gather more parts. This is inhibited by the [[Sector 3 - Gravitational Anomalies|Gravitational Anomalies]] found in it's neighboring sector and by the distance needed to get through the [[Sector 1 - Sparse Region|Sparse sector]].
