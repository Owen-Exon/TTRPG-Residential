# Amalgamations

When robots are discarded often there is some small current left in the circuits. These half-broken robots start to attempt to repair themselves with the scrap around them, unfortunately this means they often attempt to merge with other robots in the same situation. This causes a conflict when their ai's interact and they merge but with each robot only having some control.

The end result of these faulty merges is zombie-like robots without full control over themselves that roam the scrapyards attempting to repair themselves but they always end up losing more and more control as they merge more and more.

Sometimes when a merge occurs there is a kind of battle between the ai's of the robots involved and there is an opportunity for them to take control from the other/s. This usually doesn't result in a single victor.
