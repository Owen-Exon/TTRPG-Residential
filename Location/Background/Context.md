# Context

In the distant future humanity lives alongside robots, AI is everywhere and robots are designed for every possible task and whilst for many jobs (at least those considered safe enough for people) a [[minimum organic workforce|MOW]] has been established robots are more prevalent that people in most jobs.

Many robots (even those with designed with specific tasks in mind) have sufficiently advanced AI to be considered sentient and many people are friends with robots and even fall in love with them. After the death of an organic lover, Many robots request that they be decommissioned.

When robots are outdated, broken, or decommissioned for any other reason, it's usually cheaper for companies to discard the parts and buy new ones than it is to repair or recycle them. This leads to the creation of large scrapheaps. Some are "small" and are able to fit underground or on a region of a planet. Others form in space as enough scrap gets dropped to form an asteroid of scrap. Such as [[The Scrapheaps]]
