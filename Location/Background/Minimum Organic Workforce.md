# Minimum Organic Workforce

The Minimum Organic Workforce scheme (also known as MOW) was introduced to avoid robotic automation taking over completely and to force companies to have a percent of their workforce as organic. For every Â£100,000 of revenue made per year, one more percent of their workforce must be organic. Up to a maximum of 50%.

Exceptions to the rule:

- Jobs considered to dangerous for people must be given to robots.
- Any artistic jobs are primarily organic due to AIs inability to perfectly mimic organic art. (Not a Law, just common practice)
  - This incudes:
  - music
  - painting
  - designing artistic (non-function) objects
