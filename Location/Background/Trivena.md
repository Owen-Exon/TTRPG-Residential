# Trivena

Used to be a peaceful farming planet but when [[the Hand of the Galaxy]] began to occupy them and forced large proportions of their crops to be "offered" to [[the Hand of the Galaxy|the hand]] the people began to revolt.

Now no more crops grow and the majority of the planet is a wasteland after the war that ensued. [[the Hand of the Galaxy|The hand]] claimed the planets destruction to be a victory and used it as propaganda to show their power over those that would resist but many people considered the revolutions to have won since their planet may have been destroyed but people also started questioning their reach.
