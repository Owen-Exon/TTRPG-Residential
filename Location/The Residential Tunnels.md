# The Residential Tunnels

These tunnels are surrounding the [[Community Halls]].

This is where the vast majority of people living on [[Astroid 4k2l]] live.

If a flat isn't being lived in then it is free to claim. If there are no empty ones residents usually live with a friend or relative but if they want to live on their own they will barter with a current resident to get them to move out.

There are approximately 120 flats. (But that number is increasing over time)
