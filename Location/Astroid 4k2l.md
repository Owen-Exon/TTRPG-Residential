# Astroid 4k2l

Summary:
    - Size : 1km across

This is just one asteroid found in the [[Sector 4 - Calm Region|Calm Region]] of [[The Scrapyard belt]]. There is nothing particularly *unique* about it. But unlike most asteroids in the belt, it is inhabited.

Since the asteroid doesn't have a magnetic field, it doesn't make sense to speak about north or south so location is given relative to other objects.

These are the different Sides of the asteroid:

- [[Signal Side]]
- [[Lonely Side]]
- [[Grav Side]]
- [[Sunken Side]]
- [[Steel Side]]
- [[City Side]]
