# City Side

This side of the astroid contains a partly subterranean village with a permanent population of about 100 and 20 to 50 temporary residents (usually [[astro scrap hunters|astro scrappers]])

Most exchanges in [[The Scrapyard belt]] are made by bartering with scrap and technology.

## Above the Ground

All of the building above ground are made from random pieces of scrap welded together.

These buildings tend to be commercial not residential and each one is usually made by someone for their own use. Some buildings above ground are:

- [[The greenhouse]]
- [[The Silos]]
- [[Atkins Augmentation]]
- [[The Bookkeepers Building]]
- [[The Landing Pads]]

## Below the Ground

Below the ground most buildings are residential with some exceptions. If a flat isn't being lived in then it is free to claim unless there are too few free ones in which case residents are required to live with a friend or relative. If they don't have any then they can claim an empty one. People will barter if they want one for themselves.

These are some of the areas underground:

- [[The Residential Tunnels]]
- [[The Warehouse]]
