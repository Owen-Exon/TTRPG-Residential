# The greenhouse

All the organic waste created by the residents of the [[City Side]] is used as fertilizer in the greenhouse. All the food eaten by the residents of the asteroid is produced here and it is big enough to feed them all comfortably. Very often excess food will be sold to other settlements across [[Sector 4 - Calm Region|Sector 4]].

The greenhouse is made from massive glass sheets that have been made pieces of sandstone asteroids.

The person who manages the greenhouse is [[Marrie Bridger]]

This food gets stored in [[The Silos]].

These are some of the different crops in the greenhouse:

- scintilla-wheat
  - a kind of wheat that grows with very little aid.
  - It's named due to the small electric current it produces.
- alk tree
  - These genetically modified trees grow a variety of common fruits (apples, oranges etc.) all at the same time.
  - They look very similar to oak trees.
- Alk seed
  - Same as alk tree but for veg.
- lactum plant
  - A large lily pad like plant which needs water to grow in.
  - It oozes this milk like substance.
- pyrus bean
  - A fast growing bean which if not harvested carefully can set on fire.
  - This makes them integral to the infrastructure of [[Astroid 4k2l]]
