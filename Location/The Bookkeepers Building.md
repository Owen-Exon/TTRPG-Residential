# The Bookkeepers Building

This is the closest [[Astroid 4k2l]] has to a normal business. They will take scrap and store it in [[The Warehouse]] before transporting it out of [[The Scrapyard belt]] to be sold on the black market.

The Inhabitants of [[City Side]] all have an unofficial arrangement with the Bookkeepers and each other that they will give scrap to them in exchange for the food of [[The greenhouse]] and [[The Residential Tunnels]].
