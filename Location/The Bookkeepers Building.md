# The Bookkeepers Building

This is the closest [[Astroid 4k2l]] has to a normal business. They will take scrap and store it in [[The Warehouse]] before transporting it out of [[The Scrapyard belt]] to be sold on the black market.

The Inhabitants of [[City Side]] all have an unofficial arrangement with the Bookkeepers and each other that they will give scrap to them in exchange for the food of [[The greenhouse]] and [[The Residential Tunnels]].

## The Senior Bookkeeper

The current senior bookkeeper is [[Imber Raein]]. The role of the senior bookkeeper is to overview the operations of the other bookkeepers and [[Astroid 4k2l.md|the astroid]] as a whole.

## Junior Bookkeepers

Junior bookkeepers have a variety of roles but since they are new to the organization they are generally assigned tasks like sorting through scrap and simpler oversight tasks. Many who fail to pass as Junior bookkeeper will choose to become one of [[The watchers]]

One junior bookkeeper is [[Cromhall Dauding]]
