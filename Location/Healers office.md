# Healers office

Run by the [[City Side]] doctor [[Lucina Decker]], this is the place that the residents of [[City Side]] go to get healed after accidents. Due to the abundance of [[med-packs]] only the most dramatic wounds must be tended to by a trained healer (usually amputations or great illness). This is often followed by a trip to [[Atkins Augmentation]] or one of the other technologists to help people live with their condition.
