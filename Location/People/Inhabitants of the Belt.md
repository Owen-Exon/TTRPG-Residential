# Inhabitants of the Belt

Most inhabitants of [[The Scrapyard belt]] are [[astro scrap hunters]] and their families. Some live there to escape the law and some just like it there.

All are implanted with an [[oxygen shield]] implanted in their neck. This allows them to breathe on the asteroids and also protects them from the extreme temperatures of space.

Some inhabitants are:

- [[Klenna Krisborn]] (Scrapper)
- [[Gareth Atkins]] (Engineer)
- [[Pike Atkins]] (Shop Owner)
- [[Marrie Bridger]] (Gardener)
- [[Alexander Losser]] (Barman)
- [[Lucina Decker]] (Doctor)
- [[Nona Green-Fletcher]] (Watcher)
- [[Kort Bridleton]] (Furnace Manager)
- [[Imber Rain]] ([[The Bookkeepers Building|Bookkeeper]])
- [[Cromhall Dauding]] ([[The Bookkeepers Building|Bookkeeper]])
