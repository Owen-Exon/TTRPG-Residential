# Nona Green-Flecher

Nona is one of [[The watchers]] and is considered the most dedicated of them. In reality she is only doing it to keep an eye out for anyone connected with [[the Hand of the Galaxy]] that can take her back home.

She has never been able to escape before since very few rockets fly from [[Astroid 4k2l]] and those that do are full.

## Appearance

Short blonde hair, anonymized grey uniform of junior [[the Hand of the Galaxy|hands]].

## Childhood

She grew up in [[Klissomata]] and quickly found an interest in government and politics and joined a small branch of [[the Hand of the Galaxy]] specializing in [[Amalgamations]]. On A routine inspection of [[The Scrapyard belt]] her ship crashed into an asteroid and she got found by [[Alexander Losser]] and her burns healed with little scaring by [[Lucina Decker]]. These are the only people who know her past.
