# Lucina Decker

Lucina Decker is the most skilled healer on [[Astroid 4k2l]] and can almost always be found in the [[Healers office]]. She enjoys talking to people but dislikes groups due to her upbringing. She lost her eye to a piece of shrapnel whilst healing [[Pike Atkins]]

## Appearance

## Childhood

Lucina grew up on a space station in deep space with only a small group of other people. Her parents where researchers there but they were the only "permanent" residents. Over time she grew interested in the mechanics of healing and taught herself by watching and talking to the stations healer. After a few years she moved to [[Huria]]. Because of her lack of formal training she could never practice officially and this meant she got many criminals at her door. At one of these instances she deliberately killed her patient after they confessed to killing a large group of people of which she had friends in. After this she ran to [[The Scrapyard belt]] and ended up finding work in [[City Side]]

## Methods

Much of Lucina's healing is done by hand because she believes that robots don't have the cognitive capabilities found in people. Weather or not this is true she *does* have a very high success rate for all types of injury and disease that she's treated.
