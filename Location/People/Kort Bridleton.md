## Childhood

Kort traveled to [[The Scrapyard belt]] to find someone who could wipe his memory so he didn't have to remember the murders he saw on his home planet [[Huria]], he found and asked [[Lucina Decker]] (with the help of tech from [[The Bookkeepers Building|The Bookkeepers]]). Because of this Kort (and anyone not involved) believes he suffered an amnesic episode resulting in an inability to remember anything of his life before.
