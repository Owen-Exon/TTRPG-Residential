# Klenna Krisborn

Klenna Krisborn is a solitary natured [[astro scrap hunters|astro scrapper]] that lives on [[Astroid 4k2l]]. She is known by the other inhabitants of the asteroid as being antisocial and combative so they usually avoid her home on the [[Lonely Side]].

## Childhood

Klenna grew up in what has now become the [[Sector 1 - Sparse Region|Sparse Region]] of the [[The Scrapyard belt]] and has only leaves once a year to sell her wares. Her parents died whists scavenging near the [[Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core|amalgamation core]] and since then she has slowly moved anticlockwise around the belt until she reached where she lives now.

## House

She lives in an underground structure she created herself in the [[Lonely Side]]. It mostly contains scrap she's found and things she needs to live. (Including a small crop of food)

## Cybernetic Enhancements

Over time, Klenna has augmented herself with pieces of robots from [[The Scrapyard belt]], this augmentations make her well suited for the environment there but they occasionally display [[Amalgamations|Amalgamation]] like behavior.

A summary of her augmentations:

- Replaced Right Arm with the arm of the [[Amalgamations|Amalgamation]] which took hers.
- Oxygen shield implanted in her neck (As with all [[Inhabitants of the Belt]])
- Frames build from various hydraulic parts around her legs to allow her to jump from astroid to asteroid.
- Etc.
