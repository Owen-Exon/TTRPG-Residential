# The watchers

This is a group of people who spend time in the [[Signal Side|Signal tower]] of [[Astroid 4k2l]] to monitor it's systems and to keep and eye out for [[Amalgamations]].

They have a room at the top of the signal tower which doesn't control the main mast (used by [[The Bookkeepers Building|The Bookkeepers]]) but instead controls a series of smaller, less directional masts that allow them to scan space. They are also sometimes asked to scan for a certain type of scrap.
