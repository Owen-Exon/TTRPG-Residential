# Alexander Losser

Alexander (alex to friends), is a bartender in the [[Community Halls]]. He enjoys company and will often chat to the patrons for hours. When not working alex will go searching through [[The Scrapyard belt]] for any life such as plants or small animals that have evolved to survive there. He is yet to find any but is convinced there will be some somewhere.

## Appearance

Alex is almost always wearing green, and whilst working he wears a waistcoat adorned with gemstones.

## Childhood

Alexander grew up in [[Klissomata]] but racked up large gambling debts and ran from the people he borrowed money from. He traveled for many years but could never escape. This is because the money lenders had injected him with a tracker without his knowledge. He got it removed by a doctor but since then has sworn off all cybernetic enhancements (except the [[oxygen shield]]) for fear of external access or control.

## Serving Drinks

The range of options for drinks is limited in [[The Scrapyard belt]], both soft and hard. The juice from fruits of the alk tree can be used and apples can be made into cider. And the grapes fermented into wine, but only in small quantities.
