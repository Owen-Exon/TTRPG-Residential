# Pike Atkins

Pike is a tech expert who sells cybernetic enhancements from his shop on [[Astroid 4k2l]]: [[Atkins Augmentation]]. He loves combining technological and organic components and has developed many new augmentations whilst living in the [[The Scrapyard belt]].

## Appearance

Half of his face and the arm on his left side is cybernetic after an explosion occurred while experimenting with scrap. Whilst being healed by [[Lucina Decker]] a piece left in him exploded and damaged her right eye. He is always wearing a grey/green vest with black trowsers. Many who don't know him think he looks stern but in reality he is a very friendly person.

## Childhood

He grew up in [[Klissomata]] as part of the wealthy [[The green family|green family]] where he was expected to go into [[the Hand of the Galaxy]] but after a scandal that devastated the rest of his family he took it as an opportunity and fled to a planet where he could learn how to work with tech. A few years after he finished his training his then partner, now husband [[Gareth Atkins]] wanted to escape the control of [[the Hand of the Galaxy]] and to they both moved to [[The Scrapyard belt]]
