These are bags full of small metallic discs. If someone has an injury that is refusing to heal they can place one of these on an unaffected area and the nanobots within the disc will first read the nearby cells to find out what is normal for that species and then travel the body repairing damage.

If they are placed on an ill area (eg. a rash bruise) they will assume that is how the body is meant to be and try to "repair" it. This causes horrific injuries that require specialist attention urgently.
