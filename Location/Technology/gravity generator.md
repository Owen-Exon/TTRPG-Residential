# Gravity Generators

These are pieces of technology that allow the creation of fine tuned gravitational fields. They emit vast numbers of gravitons in all directions. These gravitons are controlled by these rings around the core that block them.

Sometimes if the configuration rings are misarranged or the core is damaged anti-gravitons will be produced instead causing gravitational anomies (or repulsion if that is the desired outcome).
