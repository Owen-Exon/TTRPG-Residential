# oxygen shield

This is device that is embedded in the back of a persons neck that creates a shield of oxygen around them. This allows them to breath even when there is no other oxygen. The oxygen is produced from water drunk by the person where it is stored in a condensed form and slowly released in a shield that forms directly around a persons body. It also provides protection from the extreme temperatures of the vacuum of space.

Oxygen shields also usually come build in with automatic proximity comms. (Mimics how conversation works when within an atmosphere.)

This is the most common augmentation done by [[Atkins Augmentation]].
