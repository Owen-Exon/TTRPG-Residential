# The Scrapyard Belt

The scrapyard Belt is a series of asteroids made from the scrapped parts of millions of robots and pieces of technology. Usually each asteroid forms around one or more discarded gravity generators (Or ones placed by [[astro scrap hunters]]). This often makes navigating the scrapyard very dangerous due to gravitational anomalies. This also applies to walking around the asteroids since where they are stable there is relatively strong gravity, but in areas the gravity becomes weaker or even reverses and can fling you off into space.

The asteroid field has 5 main regions:

- [[Sector 1 - Sparse Region]]
- [[Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core]]
- [[Sector 3 - Gravitational Anomalies]]
- [[Sector 4 - Calm Region]]
- [[Sector 5 - Dense Region]]

The asteroids all orbit clockwise from the view of the map. When referring to locations as clockwise or anti-clockwise of another, this is the reference used.

The belt stably orbits a black hole, but this does mean that very few risk straying inwards from the belt to avoid risking getting trapped by the strong gravity or time dilation effects. These time dilation effects also mean that the amalgamation core are unable to travel directly across to the opposite regions since people would see them coming and have years to prepare.
