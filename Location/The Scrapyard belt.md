# The Scrapyard Belt

The scrapyard Belt is a series of asteroids made from the scrapped parts of millions of robots and pieces of technology. Usually each asteroid forms around one or more discarded gravity generators (Or ones placed by [[astro scrap hunters]]). This often makes navigating the scrapyard very dangerous due to gravitational anomalies. This also applies to walking around the asteroids since where they are stable there is relatively strong gravity, but in areas the gravity becomes weaker or even reverses and can fling you off into space.

The asteroid field has 5 main regions:

- [[Sector 1 - Sparse Region]]
- [[Sector 2 - Amalgamation Core]]
- [[Sector 3 - Gravitational Anomalies]]
- [[Sector 4 - Dense Region]]
- [[Sector 5 - Calm Region]]
