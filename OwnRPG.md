# The System

When choosing ability scores, a player may distribute 60 points between their 12 different stats. Each one may have a max of 8 and min of 3. Alternatively they can roll 2d4 for each skill or 2d4 12 times and chose which skill each score is assigned to.

When making a check, a player states what they want to do, they then take the two relevant ability scores (decided by the DM) and add them. The DM then states the DC. If the total is greater than the DC, the player passes. If it is lower, they may play cards from their hand to increase their score. After a check is done the player draws cards until their hand is full again. *A check may not be done more than once.*

When a character loses health, the size of their hand decreases, any extra cards must be discarded. These cards are the players choice, but *if a card is a de-buff card it can't be discarded until the effect ends*

After an appropriately long rest (with an undisturbed sleep) a players health returns to normal and all their cards get returned to and shuffled in their deck.

Opposed actions are when two people are trying to achieve different (opposing) things, for example, attack/defend, grapple/escape. The two parties add their respective stats and then add cards to them to try achieve the higher value. The one with the highest value wins.
