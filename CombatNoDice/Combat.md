# Combat

At the start of each encounter, a number of decks of cards are shuffled together.

Order of play is determined by drawing a card for each player and seeing who has the highest. Those with equal scores draw again until one comes out on top. Each player keeps the last card they draw and every other card is placed at the bottom of the deck.

When a players turn is reached they may take one primary action, and two card actions.

## Primary Actions

These are actions which relate directly to the encounter at hand. It could be making an attack, setting a trap, or aiding an ally.

The primary action may be forfeit in exchange for 2 additional card actions

### Attacking

An attack made will take the score in the players relevant skill and add any bonuses from weapons. If the total is greater than the enemies defense (plus bonuses) the total is dealt in damage.

### Other

Any other actions will use the relevant skill plus bonuses and the DM's DC to determine success.

## Card Actions

There are several options

The player can:

- draw from the draw pile
- pass one card to another player
- link one set of cards
- scatter one set of cards
