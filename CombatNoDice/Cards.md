# Cards

## Actions

During combat, a player may hold any number of cards in their hand. Until their turn is over at which point a player can only hold three cards.

### Drawing Cards

When a card is drawn it is drawn from the top of the draw pile

### Passing cards

Only one card may be passed between players at a time. One player may be passed as many cards as people wish until the end of that players round by which point all but three cards must be discarded or applied.

### linking and scattering

When a player has one of the possible special combinations of cards they may link them to their own, or the party's joint character sheet.

If a player wishes to reclaim the cards linked to a character sheet, they may scatter them causing them to return to their hand.

## Combinations

### Runs

Any run of a single suit may be linked to increase a single players score in that skill. A run of 3 increases it by one point. And an additional point is gained for every extra card beyond 3 is added to the run. Ace can either be low or high.

### n of a kind

3 or more of a kind can be linked to the parties character sheet to increase all skills for all players by 1 for every card above 2.
